<p> 2 Players game. To win the game one of the players needs to collect one hundred points. </p>
<p> In each throw player gathers current points, which can be collected by hold button, then the turn will change. </p>
<p> Throwing 1 on both dice reset current points and change turn. </p>
<p> Throwing 1 on one die reduce points by 1/3 and change turn. </p>
<p> If one of the players achieve one hundred points, the unlucky factor will be displayed (percentage of how many times each player threw 1 for all throws they had). The probability of throwing 1 is around 31%, that means the player can be considered unlucky if their 'unlucky factor' is above that number. The player with higher unlucky factor can still be victorious. </p>
